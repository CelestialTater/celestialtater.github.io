            <p id = 'qn' class='qn'>Did you find the use of media helpful? Do you think English courses should use more non-standard texts?</p>
            <p id = 'pg'> I personally found the variety of media types in the course both helpful and enjoyable. I found it made it more enjoyable to look ahead at the content for the next week knowing that it would be something new. Specifically with The Tempest, I found it very beneficial to view the play and movie versions, as well as audiobooks as you suggested. While I had studied Shakespeare in the past, I had never taken full advantage of these forms of media before and I felt that I understood the content more thoroughly once I did. <br><br>I think that the use of non-standard texts, specifically many of the videos, made the course more engaging. Understanding how videos can have just as many symbols and themes as any other text was fairly new to me, and it added a level of depth to the course that I enjoyed. I hope that in future courses I will also see a variety of media forms.</p>
