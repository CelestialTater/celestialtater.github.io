            <li>Take your time on the energy level screen. Make sure you know how much energy you need!</li>
            <li>Estimation is a good technique. Most of the time you won't need to know the exact value you need, just the general area.</li>
            <li>Try to find a path to the photon that will involve very few of the incorrect photons</li>
            <li>Be careful not to stand still! The photons move randomly and an incorrect one could move into you!</li>
            <li>Keep an eye on the time. If you run out of time, you lose!</li>
            <li>There are 5 levels. As the levels get harder, more incorrect photons appear and the timer gets shorter!</li>
            <li>As the time gets shorter, you will need to start moving faster! Remember that you cannot speed up your movement.</li>
